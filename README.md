Eonil's Aliens library.







This is a collection of small to medium sized external code. (large
code such as Bullet will be separated into a separated project)

The `Aliens` project is an aggregation library. You can use each component 
projects directly if you don't want all the features at once.

This library may contains a stub function or classes to make it easier to use
each features.

Name Clash
----------
This library may contains several hidden symbols by the included libraries.
And these symbols may clash with symbols in your program. I am not doing anything on this issue
currently, because I couldn't find a nice way to avoid this. Anyway I will add some hiding symbol 
tricks as soon as I discover one.
